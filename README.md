'Hello, world!'
This is my first project that I am doing on my own outside of Flatiron School.
I will be using all the tools I have learned throughout the entire prework and some new tools I will pick up along that way (thank you google).
I will be creating a countdown that will mark the beginning and end of my journey as a student at Flatiron School(Aug 29, 2022-December 9, 2022). 
I hope to look back on not only this README.me, but the project itself a year from now and have pride in the work I have put in. 
Enough typing. Time to get to work!
