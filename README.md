'Hello, world!'
This is my first project that I am working on outside of Flatiron School's pre-work.
I will be using all the tools I have learned throughout the entire prework and some new tools I will pick up along that way (thanks to google).
Due to my eagernees to become a Software Developer, creating a countdown that marks the end of my journey as a student at Flatiron School(December 9, 2022) seems justifiable. 
I hope to look back on not only this README.me, but the project itself a year from now and see how far I have come as a developer.
Hopefully I make future me proud.  
Enough typing. Time to get to work!
